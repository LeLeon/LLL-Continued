FuelTank Patch  …
- changed content compared to size of stock counterparts
- changed mass & cost related to content and stock
- added entryCost (cost*5)
- reviewed FSfuelSwitch module:
Fuel will now cost credits, wasn't calculated before, is now hardcoded
as "tankCost", upscaled prices fit to upscaled stock counterparts.
Should be a bit more expensive, because LLL tanks are lighter. I
couldn't fix the scaled mass, "tankMass" won't work, so i did it over
costs.
- added structural option to all cubed tanks (not 2x1 spherical tank)
- added Ore option on 1x1 tanks
- some visual stripes/ pipes for karbonite, structural, ore
- LLL_Scale_Exponents.cfg added for the scaled tankcost.

Known issue:
Downscaling will lead to ABSOLUTE SICK costs, especially when scaling
Xenon. Thats a problem of Tweakscale and FSfuelSwitch. If FSfuelSwitch
would work correct with fuelcosts, Tweakscale wouldn't go crazy with
downscaling.



Balance Batch  …
Balancing of cost, mass, entrycost, mass, ressources &
Fixes for attachrules, stock drag, maxtemp, crashtolerance for
categories:
- Engines
- Command & Control
- Coupling
- Payload
- Aero

Other:
- fixed Cargo bays nodes ID correction (but still broken)
- fixed position of exhaust plume on 2x1Nuclear engine
- removed unused ElectricCharge on some engines
- removed "always on"-generator on nuclear engines in exchange of
positive alternator generator



Electrical Patch  …
- all: cost, entrycost, mass, some attributes tweaked
- TACLS boxes make now sense with amount. All three boxes hold almost
same amount of kerbal days consumption.
- ShroudPanel and batteries now work with Tweakscale.
- Rework of Extractor Fan (Lack's Air Compression Generator). It's now
IntakeAir generator like Wind Turbine, but less effective (also lighter)
- Generator (+small) use now LFO, consumption compared to stock. Fit
between the stock fuel generators. Bigger generator got small battery.
- Solar panels are now more efficient, can be compared to stock solar
panels, 2x1SolarPanel has a battery now

- Salt reactor massive changes:
- 120 ec/sec output
- need Xenon input
- has small Xenon tank
- has battery
- need a lot of cooling, 800W !!
- efficiency is much more depending on cooling, than every other
generator i know.
F.e. 400 W cooling power = ~30% efficiency

- Fission plant massive changes:
- need Xenon input
- has small Xenon tank
- has battery
- need cooling, 150W
- efficiency is much more depending on cooling, than every other
generator i know.
F.e. 75 W cooling power = ~30% efficiency



Utility Batch  …
- rebalance of cost, entrycost, mass and some attributes

Buggys fuel cell now consume LFO, got tanks for it.

Category Structural Balance  …
- balance in cost, entryCost, mass, some attachrules
- many adapters and structural hull segments have now switch between
blank structural and different fuel settings, depending on size...
- ... in exchange, all these parts lost crew capacity, but for that next
to normal crew hulls i ...
- ... added a half sized, half flat cupola for one Kerbal, that fits on
1x1 and higher hulls



TACLifeSupport Fixes  …
Greenhouse, water purifier, carbon extractor, 2x1LifeSupport (huge
crate)
- fixed codes for TACLS, works now
- balanced techtree, cost, entryCost, mass, tags, bulkheadprofiles

2x1lifesupport:
- balanced content values ratio
- own colored label for the box

All parts ingame moved from standard category to custom category "Life
Support" of CommunityCategoryKit (served with TACLS). No double entries.



Ground Batch
Changes:
- balanced cost, entryCost, mass
- added ModuleAnimateGeneric to Skid and UndersideLeg, removed patch file for that
- disabled LargeWheel because of skin flicker and visual problems

Note:
None of the landing legs have leg functionality, just visual animation!
