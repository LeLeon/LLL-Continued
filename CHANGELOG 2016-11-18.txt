Changelog:

All categories:
- balanced techtree, cost, entryCost, mass, tags, bulkheadprofiles

FuelTank:
- changed tank content compared to size of stock counterparts
- changed mass & cost related to content and stock

Reviewed FSfuelSwitch module:
Fuel will now cost credits, wasn't calculated before, is now hardcoded
as "tankCost", upscaled prices fit to upscaled stock counterparts.
Should be a bit more expensive, because LLL tanks are lighter. I
couldn't fix the scaled mass, "tankMass" won't work, so i did it over
costs.

- added structural option to all cubed tanks (not 2x1 spherical tank)
- added Ore option on 1x1 tanks
- some visual stripes/ pipes for karbonite, structural, ore
- LLL_Scale_Exponents.cfg added for the scaled tankcost.

Known issue:
Downscaling will lead to ABSOLUTE SICK costs, especially when scaling
Xenon. Thats a problem of Tweakscale and FSfuelSwitch. If FSfuelSwitch
would work correct with fuelcosts, Tweakscale wouldn't go crazy with
downscaling.

Electrical:

- ShroudPanel and batteries now work with Tweakscale.
- rework of Extractor Fan (Lack's Air Compression Generator). It's now
IntakeAir generator like Wind Turbine, but less effective (also lighter)
- Generator (+small) use now LFO, consumption compared to stock. Fit
between the stock fuel generators. Bigger generator got small battery.
- Solar panels are now more efficient, can be compared to stock solar
panels, 2x1SolarPanel has a battery now

Salt reactor massive changes:
- 120 ec/sec output
- need Xenon input
- has small Xenon tank
- has battery
- need a lot of cooling, 800W !!
- efficiency is much more depending on cooling, than every other
generator i know.
F.e. 400 W cooling power = ~30% efficiency

Fission plant massive changes:
- need Xenon input
- has small Xenon tank
- has battery
- need cooling, 150W
- efficiency is much more depending on cooling, than every other
generator i know.
F.e. 75 W cooling power = ~30% efficiency

Structural:
- many adapters and structural hull segments have now switch between
blank structural and different fuel settings, depending on size...
- ... in exchange, all these parts lost crew capacity, but for that next
to normal crew hulls i ...
- ... added a half sized, half flat cupola for one Kerbal, that fits on
1x1 and higher hulls
- added 1x1 Long Cap, /holds EC and Mono, length of 1x1 third

Ground:
- added ModuleAnimateGeneric to Skid and UndersideLeg, removed patch file for that
- disabled LargeWheel because of skin flicker and visual problems
- disabled broken (floating) landingleg

Note:
None of the landing legs have leg functionality, just visual animation!

TACLifeSupport Fixes:
- fixed/added codes for Greenhouse, water purifier, carbon extractor
- TACLS boxes make now sense with amount. All three boxes hold almost same amount of kerbal days
- 2x1lifesupport, balanced content values ratio, own colored label for the box
- all parts ingame moved from standard category to custom category "Life
Support" of CommunityCategoryKit (served with TACLS). No double entries.

Misc:
- Buggys fuel cell now consume LFO, got tanks for it.
- fixed Cargo bays nodes ID (but still broken)
- fixed position of exhaust plume on 2x1Nuclear engine
- fixed fairing codes update to normal status
- removed unused ElectricCharge on some engines
- removed "always on"-generator on nuclear engines in exchange of
positive alternator generator
- removed duplicate files to prevent log spam
PartDisable files fix:
- changed codes of LLL_PartDisabler.cfg & LLL_PartDisableLargerSizes.cfg
The disabled parts are disabled ingame (were previously still ingame
in advanced filters). ~160 patches less at start

- added BrokenParts 2016-11-18.txt , list with problematic parts

LLL & LLL-Extra sort:
Some parts moved, so LLL-Extra don't will be needed for normal game.
Here can be found: 2x2, 4x4, 3x1, 4x1, 6x1 size subtypes and prototype
parts. Most parts in LLL-Extra are disabled through config.

LLL-Extra to LLL:
- Droopy cockpit, Buster cockpit, EagleCrewPod, 2x1LifeSupport
LLL to LLL-LLL-Extra (all parts actually disabled)
- BERTY, BERTYMechjeb, 2x1ASAS, 5WayRCS, attachable Counterweights, RadialJetEngine, HeatTiles parts, 2x2 related parts, 4x4 related parts
